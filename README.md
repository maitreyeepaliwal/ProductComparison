## Human Computer Interaction project interface

Human Computer Interaction today greatly emphasizes on developing more spontaneous and natural interfaces. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) on 
Personal Computers (PCs) is quiet developed, well defined and also provides an efficient interface for a user to interact with the computer and access the various 
applications effortlessly with the help of mouse, track pad, etc. Moreover, in the 
present day scenario most of the mobile phones are using touch screen 6
technology to interact with the user. But this technology is still not cheap to be 
used in desktops and laptops. <br /> <br />
*Discovering a cheaper and more flexible way to interact with the system is a great need today.*

In this project, I have used the existing template by codrops for product comparison with some modifications to compare the different modes by which humans can interact with a computer
